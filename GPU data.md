# Moving Data GPU

```
def GPU(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device=torch.device('cuda'))

def GPU_data(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=False, dtype=torch.float, device=torch.device('cuda'))\
```

The functions `GPU` and `GPU_data` you've provided are designed to move data to a GPU device in PyTorch. They create PyTorch tensors with specific properties. Here's an explanation of both functions:

1. `GPU(data)`:
   - Input: `data` (a NumPy array or any data that can be converted to a PyTorch tensor)
   - Output: Returns a PyTorch tensor with the following properties:
     - `requires_grad=True`: Indicates that gradients should be computed for this tensor, which is useful for training neural networks.
     - `dtype=torch.float`: Specifies the data type of the tensor as float.
     - `device=torch.device('cuda')`: Specifies that the tensor should be placed on the GPU for computation.

2. `GPU_data(data)`:
   - Input: `data` (a NumPy array or any data that can be converted to a PyTorch tensor)
   - Output: Returns a PyTorch tensor with the following properties:
     - `requires_grad=False`: Indicates that gradients should not be computed for this tensor. This is typically used for data that doesn't require gradient computation, such as input data.
     - `dtype=torch.float`: Specifies the data type of the tensor as float.
     - `device=torch.device('cuda')`: Specifies that the tensor should be placed on the GPU for computation.

These functions are helpful when you want to ensure that your data is stored on the GPU for accelerated computation, and you can control whether gradients should be computed for the tensor by using either `GPU` or `GPU_data` based on your specific use case.

Here's an example of how you might use these functions:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
data_array = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Use GPU_data to move the data to the GPU without gradient computation
gpu_data = GPU_data(data_array)

# Use GPU to move the data to the GPU with gradient computation
gpu_data_with_grad = GPU(data_array)
```

In this example, `gpu_data` will be a PyTorch tensor on the GPU without gradient computation, and `gpu_data_with_grad` will be a PyTorch tensor on the GPU with gradient computation enabled.
